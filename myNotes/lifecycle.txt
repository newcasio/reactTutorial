render
Render called when state or props change.

__________________________________________
componentDidMount(){
  CODE HERE
}


Class method.
React will run this method as soon as the component shows up on the screen.  A re-render will not cause this to run again.  Use for API call.

Fetch - built in JS function to using HTTP to retrieve data.  Returns a promise, so use .then

Star Wars API https://swapi.co

__________________________________________
componentWillRecieveProps(nextProps){
  if (nextProps.whatever !== this.props.whatever ){
    //do something
  }
}

THIS HAS BEEN DEPRECATED
Will run on mounting, plus each time a parent component passing down props to this component.  Can use an if statement to check if new props are different to existing props, and do something.

__________________________________________
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState){
  //condition false will not updated, true will update
}

React will re-render if something changes.  This can stop re-rendering to increase performance.

__________________________________________
componentWillUnmount(){
  //code
}

Component be removed from screen.  Remove unneccesary clutter from screen.

__________________________________________
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(){
  //create a backup of the current way things are
}
